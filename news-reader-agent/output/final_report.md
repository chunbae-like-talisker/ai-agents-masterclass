## 🎯 Editor’s Analysis  
**Key Themes Today:**  
- Escalation of conventional warfare meets 21st-century tech: drones and cyber-influence  
- ASEAN’s unity and credibility tested by intramural conflict  

**What This Means:**  
The Cambodia–Thailand clash underscores the fragile security architecture in Southeast Asia. If unchecked, it may prompt external powers to deepen military ties, potentially drawing in China, the U.S., and India. ASEAN’s ability to mediate will shape its future role as a regional peacekeeper. Meanwhile, the use of drones and online propaganda signals a new era of low-intensity yet high-impact skirmishes.  

**Looking Ahead:**  
- Outcomes of the November 6 UN meeting and November 7 ASEAN summit  
- Potential for a mediated ceasefire agreement vs. risk of spillover into other border provinces  
- The role of major powers (China, U.S.) in brokering or exacerbating the standoff
