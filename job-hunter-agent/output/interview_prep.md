## Job Overview
- Role: Senior Backend Engineer (Golang)
- Location: Remote (Europe; Netherlands eligible)
- Type: Full-time, remote-friendly
- Focus: Design, implement, and maintain high-performance Go backend services; contribute to distributed systems and cloud-native architectures; collaborate with product, data, and frontend teams; participate in code reviews and CI/CD improvements; drive architectural decisions for scalable systems.
- Tech emphasis: Go, Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), SQL/NoSQL; strong emphasis on backend scalability, reliability, and multi-service coordination.
- Why this fits the candidate’s profile (context): This is a best-fit senior backend opportunity given the candidate’s 3 years of backend experience, cloud and containerization exposure (AWS, Docker, CI/CD), and a demonstrated drive to grow Go skills toward a seniorfrontend/backend blend. It presents a smaller experience gap relative to another Golang role and aligns with the candidate’s remote-European location and interest in cloud-native architectures. The role’s remote-first, potential visa sponsorship, and emphasis on cross-functional collaboration align with the candidate’s work history and career goals.

## Why This Job Is a Fit

## Strategic Advice
- Messaging for Go readiness
  - Be transparent about current Go ramp: acknowledge the 3-year experience gap in Go, but emphasize rapid upskilling, hands-on practice, and a concrete plan.
  - Frame yourself as a backend problem-solver with strong architectural instincts, ready to apply microservices patterns, API design discipline, and cloud-native practices to Go.
  - Highlight transferable strengths: API design, scalable data flows, cloud deployments, CI/CD improvements, observability, and collaboration with cross-functional teams.

- Interview emphasis you can own
  - Architecture and design: articulate how you’d structure a Go-based backend service, including service boundaries, data models, and reliability patterns.
  - Deliverables and impact: quantify outcomes from past roles (e.g., reduced processing time by 25%, improved mobile engagement by 40%, 30% page-load improvements) to demonstrate impact and discipline.
  - Learning plan: present a concrete 6–12 week Go ramp plan, including small pilot projects, Go microservice design exercises, and a demonstration of Go code written to solve a given problem.

- Tone and storytelling
  - Be confident but curious: show eagerness to learn Go deeply while leaning on proven backend and cloud experience.
  - Use STAR stories to illustrate collaboration, architectural decisions, and troubleshooting under pressure.
  - Emphasize alignment with DoiT’s values: teamwork, customer impact, ownership, continuous learning, and a culture of autonomy.

- Red flags to watch out for (and how to handle)
  - If asked to “prove” Go depth beyond your ramp plan, redirect to concrete steps you’ve taken to learn Go, show sample Go patterns you’re adopting, and propose a small Go pilot project you’d implement in the first 90 days.
  If a mismatch emerges between remote expectations and on-site requirements, clarify remote collaboration practices, time-zone alignment, and on-call expectations early.

- Preparation plan (practical)
  - Do 2–3 focused Go coding practice sessions (data structures, simple algorithms, and a microservice skeleton in Go) to showcase readiness.
  - Prepare 2–3 short, crisp STAR stories around backend design decisions, performance improvements, and cross-functional collaboration.
  - Compile a 1-page Go learning plan to discuss with the interviewer if appropriate, including goals, milestones, and concrete examples.

- Candidate positioning summary
  - Position as a results-driven backend engineer with strong cloud experience, ready to deepen Go expertise and contribute to DoiT’s Cloud Intelligence and FinOps initiatives.
  - Emphasize capacity for high-availability systems, scalable data processing, and a proactive approach to CI/CD and observability in a distributed, remote-first environment.
